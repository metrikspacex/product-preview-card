- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite] (https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend tooling

### What I learned & Continued development

Basically started using frontend mentor to get a process down for styling, as I
can't decide the optimal solution; rather it be css-in-js, modules, etc. I know
in the future of React18 that css-in-js will be an issue and trying to stay
ahead of that curve for the future. Also I get some practice. What I reinforced
was media queries, applying proper margins and used grid which I want to stop
using as a default in the future. The css and html isn't the greatest but it got
the job done. Hopefully in the future I will pick up better practices. Noticed
some issues with margin and padding when deployed. Will be more aware of
starting points.
